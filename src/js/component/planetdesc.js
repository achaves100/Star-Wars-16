									Tatooine is harsh desert world orbiting twin suns in the galaxyâ€™s Outer Rim. In the
									days of the Empire and the Republic, many settlers scratched out a living on
									moisture farms, while spaceport cities such as Mos Eisley and Mos Espa served as
									home base for smugglers, criminals, and other rogues.
								</p>
								<p>
									Anakin Skywalker and Luke Skywalker both once called Tatooine home, and Obi-Wan
									Kenobi spent years in hiding there. Once known as a hive of scum and villainy,
									Tatooine has become quieter since the end of the Galactic Civil War.

									Initially inhabited by native Jawa and Tusken Raider species, it saw a population
									explosion following the search for valuable mining deposits on the planet silicate
									surface. Finding the ore to have unwanted metallurgic properties, mining firms left
									the planet en masse, leaving behind valuable equipment, most notably large
									sandcrawlers, which were later used by the Jawa population.
